## Overview

Angular-based frontend for managing devices and categories. Features seamless integration with REST APIs and automated AWS deployment. Built with Angular LTS and Material Design.

## Development Environment Setup with Self-Signed Certificates

### Context

The backend API uses a self-signed certificate for HTTPS connections during development. This may cause security warnings in browsers and API clients. Here's how to configure your system to use the frontend normally while trusting the backend certificate.

### 1. Browser Configuration (Frontend Access)
